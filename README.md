# WordRandomizer
Starting Progress on a Java based app to utilize a SQL database of thousands of words to randomly generate sentences

Fun command line application I built to test out a word randomizer for a game I thought of.

As of now it is just pulling words from the var I have placed in the script.
I want to figure out how to link it to a database to have a larger selection of words to randomize but for now this is what I have.

No license or anything as it is just a little thing Iâ€™m messing around with.
